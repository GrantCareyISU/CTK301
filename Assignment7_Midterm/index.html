          <p>This is my CTK301 Midterm Micro-Site. I honestly never figured out
            if I was supposed to replace all of this with my own text or re-create
            the Lorem Ipsum. I decided upon the former due to the latter being a
            pain to type.

          <h2>Dan and the Creeks</h2>

          <p><a href="japanese.html">Dan Flashes</a> is a man who stil believes he
            is a teenager who is only popular because he sell illegal substances.
            He lives on his ex-girlfriend's couch and dresses like a guy from
            the 80s who was obsessed with Pac-Man. After he got complaints about
            being too loud while bullying kids in Xbox calls during Call of Duty
            games, he decided to get a job as a mall cop. He quickly lost his job
            upon helping a burglar find the diamond store. He is losing his hair
            faster than most people his age and quite frankly isn't even aware of
            it. His diet consists only of sweet-potato fries and Sprite. On that
            note, he has an irrational hatred of Sierra Mist. If he sees anyone
            drinking a Sierra Mist he will take their bottle and throw it as far
            as he possible can... which isn't very far.</p>
          <p><a href="japanese.html">Shops at the Creeks</a> is an outdoor mall where
            Dan likes to spend his inheritance money he got from when his parents
            died. He is usually found in the restrooms due to having finally been
            kicked out of each and every store because of his behavior.The only
            reason they allow him on the property is because the burglar he assisted
            at his former job was actually the owner of the land the outdoor mall
            is on. Prior to getting banned from going inside, his favorite store at
            the Shops at the Creeks was the Build-A-Bear workshop. His most chaotic
            moment at the workshop was when he made two bears and decided they were
            assassins who intimidated their targets by tap dancing. He imagined the
            first target of the tap dancing assassins was the employee working at
            the register at the time. She resigned the day after.</p>

        <div class="update">
          <p>According to the recent news article, Dan Flashes has been arrested.
            He is currently spending his time in the local insane asylum, where
            he spends his days kissing spoons while talking about how his cousin
            will marry him someday.</p>
