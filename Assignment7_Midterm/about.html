          <p><a href="japanese.html">What is her job?</a> Karen is an Uber driver
            hired to drive only McDonald's employees. After her outburst at the
            CEO of McDonald's, she was sued and told that the only way she could
            avoid being punished was if she put away her pride and drove the people
            she previously belittled. Instead of taking out her anger on fast food
            workers, she now screeches at other drivers for stopping at the stop
            sign. In fact, she decided to ram into the back of one vehicle for
            not blowing past a red stoplight. Unfortunately for her, the vehicle
            she hit was a cop car. After she is done with her duties at McDonald's,
            Karen will be facing criminal charges for her crimes against the human
            race. The verdict is almost certainly going to be the death penalty.</p>
          <p><a href="japanese.html">TABLES!</a> Once Karen has finished her sentence
            as a driver, she is going to move on to cleaning the dirty tables in
            various McDonald's restaurants. The CEO has secretly told all the
            managers to intentionally make all the tables as dirty as possible before
            her shift. It is most likely that Karen will have to clean bubblegum,
            maple syrup, and old nuggets caked in grease from the bottoms of the tables.
            That job will most likely lead to her beating a customer to death, which
            will only add to her criminal charges.</p>

        <div class="update">
          <p>According to the recent news article, Karen's court verdict has been
            guilty, and she is to receive the only punishment worse than the death
            penalty: listening to the "I Play Pokemon Go Everyday" song on loop for
            the rest of her life.</p>
